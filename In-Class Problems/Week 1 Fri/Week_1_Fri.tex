\section{In-Class Problems \& Solutions}
\subsection{Week 1, Fri}

\subsubsection{Problem 1.}
\textbf{\(P := \) Prove that if $a \cdot b = n $, then either $a$ or $b$ must be $\leq \sqrt{n}$, where $a$, $b$ and $n$ are nonnegative real numbers. \textit{Hint:} by contradiction Section 1.8 in the course textbook.}
\\[5pt]
Solution: We use proof by contradiction. Suppose \(P\) is false. Therefore, there exists \(a\) and \(b\) are \(>\) \(\sqrt{n}\). Whilst $a \cdot b = n$.
\[a \cdot b > \sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{n} = n\]

\noindent This is a contradiction. Therefore \(P\) must be true.
$ \blacksquare $

\subsubsection{Problem 2.}
\textbf{Generalise the proof of Theorem 1.8.1 repeated below that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational in the course textbook. For example, how about $\sqrt{3}$?.}
\\[5pt]
Solution: We use proof by contradiction. Suppose \(\sqrt{3}\) is rational. 
\[\Rightarrow \sqrt{3} = \frac{n}{d}\]
Where \(n\) and \(d\) are the lowest terms i.e., without common prime factors.
\[\Rightarrow 3 = \frac{n^2}{d^2}\]
\[\Rightarrow 3d^2 = n^2 \]
\(n^2\) is a factor of 3 which is only possible if \(n\) is also a factor of 3:
\[\Rightarrow n = 3k\]
Where \(k \in \mathbb{N}\).
\[\Rightarrow n^2 = (3k)^2 = 9k^2\]
\[\Rightarrow 3d^2 = 9k^2\]
\[\Rightarrow d^2 = 3k^2\]
Therefore, 3 is a factor of \(d^2\) which is only possible if 3 is factor of \(d\) as well.
\\[5pt]
Above we prove \(n\) and \(d\) have a common factor of 3, therefore \(n\) and \(d\) are not the lowest terms. This a contradiction. Therefore $\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number.
$\blacksquare$
\\[5pt]
\noindent
\textbf{My Extra(s):\\
1. Prove that the square root of all prime numbers are irrational.\\
2. Since 3 is a factor $n^{2}$, prove that 3 must also be a factor of $n$.}

\subsubsection{Problem 3.}
\textbf{If we raise an irrational number to an irrational power, can the result be rational? Show that it can by considering $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and arguing by cases.}
\\[5pt]
Solution: We argue by cases. Where \(a = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}, b = \sqrt{2}\).
\\[5pt]
\textbf{Case 1:} \textit{We assume $a$ is irrational.}
b is known to be irrational - \textbf{Theorem.} \textit{$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.} 
\[\Rightarrow a^{b} = \Bigl(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr)^{\sqrt{2}}\]
\[\Rightarrow \Bigl(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr)^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^{2} = 2.\]
2 can be written in the form $\frac{n}{d}$ where its lowest terms are $n = 2$ and $d = 1$. Therefore by definition, 2 is a rational number. \textit{Case 1} thus shows a irrational number raised to the power of irrational number can produce a rational number.
\\[5pt]
\noindent
\textbf{Case 2:} \textit{We assume $a$ is rational.} We introduce a third term $c$ where $c = \sqrt{2}$ - an irrational number. 
\[\Rightarrow b^{c} = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\]
Therefore $b$, an irrational number, raised to the power of $c$ also an irrational number produces a rational number, $a$.
\\[5pt]
\noindent
\textbf{Extra: Chris Reineke} - He came up with a constructive proof i.e., a specific pair of irrational numbers with this property. 
\\[5pt]
\noindent
Let $a = \sqrt{10}$,  $b = \log_{10}4$.
\[\Rightarrow a^{b} = \sqrt{10}^{\log_{10}4}\]
\[\Rightarrow \sqrt{10}^{\log_{10}4} = 10^{\log_{10}4^{1/2}} = 10^{\log_{10}2} = 2\]
$ \blacksquare $

\subsubsection{Problem 4.}
\textbf{The fact that that there are irrational numbers $a$, $b$ such that $a^{b}$ is rational was proved earlier by cases. Unfortunately, that proof was nonconstructive: it didn't reveal a specific pair, $a$, $b$ with this property. But in fact, it's easy to do this: let $a := \sqrt{2}$ and $b := 2\log_{2}3$. We know that $a = \sqrt{2}$ is irrational and $a^{b} = 3$ by definition. Finish the proof that these values for $a$, $b$ work, by showing that $2\log_{2}3$ is irrational.}
\\[5pt]
We use proof by contradiction. Suppose $2\log_{2}3$ is a rational number.
\[\Rightarrow 2\log_{2}3 = \frac{n}{d}\]
\[\Rightarrow \log_{2}3^{2} = \frac{n}{d}\]
\[\Rightarrow 2^{\frac{n}{d}} = 3^{2}\]
\[\Rightarrow 2^{n} = 3^{2d}\]
This is a contradiction as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic}{2 (an even number) can never be a prime factor of an odd number and vice versa}, provided $n, d \neq 0$. If $n, d = 0$: 
\[\Rightarrow 2^{0} = 3^{2 \times 0}\]
\[\Rightarrow 2^{0} = 3^{0}\]
\[\Rightarrow 1 = 1\]
As \href{https://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/zero-exponent-proof.php}{any number to the power of zero is 1}, is case where these two numbers are equal. Otherwise proof that $2\log_{2}3$ is an irrational number.
$ \blacksquare $

\subsubsection{My Extra(s)}
\textbf{Since 3 is a factor $n^{2}$, prove that 3 must also be a factor of $n$.}
\\[5pt] 
We consider the initial statement, 3 is a factor of $n^{2}$, then 3 is also a factor of $n$ and its contra-positive i.e., 3 is not a factor of $n$, then 3 is also not a factor of $n^{2}$.
\noindent
\\[5pt]
\textbf{Case 1. 3 is a factor of $n$}.
\\[5pt]
Let $n = 3k$. 
\[\Rightarrow n^{2} = (3k)(3k) = 9k^{2}\]
\[\Rightarrow n^{2} = 3(3k^{2})\]
3 is also a prime factor of $n^{2}$. Therefore, 3 is not a factor $n$, implies 3 is also a factor of $n^{2}$. 
\\[5pt]
\textbf{Case 2. 3 is not a factor of $n$}. 
\\[5pt]
Let $n = 3k + 1$. 
\[\Rightarrow n^{2} = (3k + 1)(3k + 1)\]
\[\Rightarrow n^{2} = 9k^{2} + 6k + 1\]
In this case, 3 is not a prime factor of $n^{2}$. Thus, 3 is not a factor of $n$ implies 3 is also not a factor of $n^{2}$. Since both cases are true, the initial statement, if 3 is a factor of $n^{2}$ then 3 is a factor of $n$ is true.
